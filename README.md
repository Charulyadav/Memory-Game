It is a simple memory game created with ReactJS.

You flip any two cards to see the image underneath. 

If they match, they stay flipped, and if they don't match then they turn back over. 

At the bottom, you'll see a turn counter to see how many turns you take to complete the game. 

To start over, click on the New Game. This will also shuffle the cards on the grid.
